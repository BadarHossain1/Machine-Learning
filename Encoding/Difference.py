Target Encoding Theory:

Target encoding, also known as mean encoding, is a technique used to encode categorical variables in a dataset. It replaces each category with the mean of the target variable for that category. This method is particularly useful in machine learning models where categorical variables have a significant impact on the target variable.

The main steps involved in target encoding are:
1. Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category.
2. Replace each category with its corresponding mean value.

Example:

Consider a dataset with a categorical feature 'Color' and a target variable 'Price':

| Color | Price |
|-------|-------|
| Red   | 100   |
| Blue  | 150   |
| Red   | 200   |
| Green | 300   |
| Blue  | 250   |
| Green | 350   |

Step 1: Calculate the mean of 'Price' for each 'Color':
- Red: (100 + 200) / 2 = 150
- Blue: (150 + 250) / 2 = 200
- Green: (300 + 350) / 2 = 325

Step 2: Replace each 'Color' with its corresponding mean value:
| Color | Price |
|-------|-------|
| 150   | 100   |
| 200   | 150   |
| 150   | 200   |
| 325   | 300   |
| 200   | 250   |
| 325   | 350   |

Target encoding helps in capturing the relationship between categorical features and the target variable, which can improve the performance of machine learning models.

Note: It is important to handle overfitting when using target encoding, especially with small datasets. Techniques such as smoothing, cross-validation, or adding noise can be used to mitigate overfitting.
